## What has changed? v2.0.0 Updates:
✅ The website is now **fully typed** *(TSX over JSX)*

✅ The website is now **globally styled** *(Emotion. No inline CSS)*

> #### **What do these improvements mean?**
>> It means the entire codebase was rebased (e.g., rebuilt). The improvements make the website more secure, responsive, and maintainable. Since we now use TypeScript (instead of JavaScript), we are able to iterate faster and with fewer bugs and less bulk.
>>
>> **Note:** No server side logic should go here! Just front end components.

## How can I start developing?

Follow the instructions below to start developing:
```bash
# To install dependencies and begin development, ensure you have an IDE installed 
# (unless you are using GitHub Codespaces) and run:
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# If `npm start` fails, run:
npm build 
npx serve -s build

# You can view the server locally or generally http://localhost:3000

```
> ###### Recommendation: Use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) if you are new to development. It comes preloaded with everything you need to get started.
>
> ###### I also recommend applying for a Pro Membership with [GitHub University](https://education.github.com/pack) to get free access to GitHub. They will literally give you $30,000 worth of tools and services.
