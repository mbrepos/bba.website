### Modified Component with Delayed Load, CRT Animation, and Fade-In

1. **Delayed Load:** Introduce a 1.75-second delay before the main component (the 3D wireframe "B" with particles) appears.
2. **CRT Animation and Fade-In:** After the delay, accompany the appearance with a warping animation resembling a CRT TV startup that fades in for a smooth transition.
3. **Note Consideration:** While the delay is introduced, there should be no warping animation; the warping animation should begin after the delay.

### Component Explanation

#### **1. Delayed Load (1.75 Seconds)**
- The `useEffect` hook uses `setTimeout` to set `isStarted` to `true` after 1.75 seconds (changed from 3 seconds).
- During this delay, the canvas remains blank because the animation loop only runs when `isStarted` is `true`, fulfilling the note's requirement that "while the delay is introduced, there is no warping animation."

#### **2. CRT Warping Animation After Delay**
- **Timing:** Once `isStarted` becomes `true`, the animation begins, and `startTimeRef` records the start time. The `progress` variable calculates how much time has elapsed since the animation started, ranging from 0 to 1 over a 1-second transition period (adjustable via `transitionDuration`).
- **Warping Effect:** A sine wave distortion is applied to the `projY` coordinates of both particles and connection lines when `progress < 1`. The distortion formula is:
  ```
  projY += Math.sin(projX * frequency) * amplitude * distortion
  ```
  where `distortion = 1 - progress` decreases from 1 to 0, reducing the warping effect over time, mimicking a CRT TV stabilizing.
- **Parameters:**
  - `frequency = 0.02`: Controls the number of waves across the screen.
  - `amplitude = 20`: Sets the maximum distortion in pixels.

#### **3. Fade-In Effect**
- The alpha values of particles and connection lines are multiplied by `progress`, which increases from 0 to 1 during the 1-second transition:
  - For particles: `alpha = p.color[3] * pulse * (1 - Math.abs(z3) / d) * progress`
  - For lines: Gradient alpha values are scaled by `progress` (e.g., `0.3 * progress`).
- This creates a smooth fade-in as the warping effect diminishes.

#### **Changes from Original**
- **Delay Adjusted:** Reduced from 3 seconds to 1.75 seconds.
- **Progress Tracking:** Added `startTimeRef` and `progress` to manage the post-delay transition.
- **Warping Added:** Introduced distortion to `projY` coordinates when `progress < 1`.
- **Fade-In Added:** Scaled alpha values with `progress`.
- **Styles Unchanged:** The Emotion styles didnâ€™t need modification since the animation is handled entirely within the canvas rendering logic.

 ~

#### **Behavior**
- **0 to 1.75 seconds:** Canvas is blank (no rendering occurs).
- **1.75 to 2.75 seconds:** After the delay, the 3D "B" appears with a CRT-like warping animation (wavy distortion) and fades in over 1 second.
- **After 2.75 seconds:** The animation continues normally without distortion or alpha scaling.

This modification ensures a blank delay period followed by a CRT-inspired warping animation and fade-in, enhancing the visual transition as requested. Let me know if you'd like to tweak the transition duration or distortion parameters further!
